// traffic tile consists of a list of entries, where each entry is either a
// Segment or a marker indicating that the traffic segment is no longer in use.
// the ID of a particular traffic segment within the tile is its offset in the
// list.
//
// the reason for including markers for deleted segments (sometimes called
// "tombstones" in the literature) is so that tiles can have continuity across
// data updates. traffic segments which have been updated in a way which is
// compatible across previous versions (i.e: map-matching returns the same road
// segments to some tolerance) will retain their IDs. anything which has changed
// too much will have the old ID marked deleted and a new ID assigned.
//
// assigning IDs therefore potentially requires looking at all previous graphs,
// and a single "master" process to assign new IDs without conflicts. since we
// anticipate data updates to be rare events (monthly, quarterly, etc...) then
// this should not be a problem. in return, we get (mostly) compact IDs which
// are (mostly) tolerant to data updates.
